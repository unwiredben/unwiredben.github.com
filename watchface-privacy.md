Ben Combee (dba Unwired Widgets) does not collect any user data.  The developer's watchface products do not send anything back to servers controlled by the developer.
We can't control what Google or the watch manufacturer does with monitoring you, but we don't record any data in our own code that is sent off device.

If you have any questions, please contact ben.combee@gmail.com.
