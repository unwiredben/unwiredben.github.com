    <section id="biography">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Ben has had a pretty active life in the mobile software world.  It's documented in a more-or-less formal way on 
      <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/unwiredben">Ben's Stack Overflow Careers CV.</a>
      <p>Ben grew up in north Georgia, went to college in Atlanta at Georgia Tech, then moved to Austin to work for Motorola's
      paging products group in IC design verification.  After a few years, he moved into compilers, working on the CodeWarrior tools
      made by Metrowerks.  He left for a startup, Veriprise, where he learned Palm OS programming, when them led to Ben becoming
      lead developer on CodeWarrior for Palm OS.  That led to a job at PalmSource in developer relations, then a engineering job at
      Palm working on the Foleo netbook.  In 2008, Ben and his then-fiancée headed to Brooklyn, NY.  While there, Ben went off
      to work at Mozilla on their mobile web browser but returned to Palm after a year to work as engineering lead on the webOS
      developer relations team.  In 2011, he and his now-wife Annelies returned to Austin to start their new life of computer hacking and
      urban farming.  In 2012, Ben was promoted to technical lead on the Enyo JavaScript framework. Now, in 2013,
      his group was transferred to LG Electronics where he continues to work on open source JS frameworks, but
      now with an emphasis on supporting application development for LG's smart TV projects.
