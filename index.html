      Palm working on the Foleo netbook.  In 2008, Ben and his then-fiancée headed to Brooklyn, NY.  While there, Ben went off
      to work at Mozilla on their mobile web browser but returned to Palm after a year to work as engineering lead on the webOS

      his group was transferred to LG Electronics where they continued development of their open source JS framework with
      an emphasis on supporting application development for LG's SmartTV projects.
      <p>In 2014, Ben moved on to a new role
      as a senior developer at Roku working on Roku OS, the Linux distribution and middelware software that powers
      all of Roku's video streaming product.  He's currently the software architect for user interface performance and provides
      technical guidance and on-device software infastructure for many of Roku's user interface teams.
      Previously, he was heavily involved in the release of Roku TV models for TCL, Hisense, Insignia, Sharp, and other brands,
