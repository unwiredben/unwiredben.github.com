# Unwired Widgets

Unwired Widgets is my "doing business as" name for publishing free applications that I upload to various online storefronts, such as the Roku Channel Store and Google Play.

The name comes from a fictional company that I used for examples in my 2001 book ["Palm OS Web Application Developers Guide"](https://www.amazon.com/Palm-Application-Developers-Guide-CD-ROM/dp/1928994326).

Here's a list of active applications available (or soon to be available):

* Resistor Time for wearOS on Google Play Store (link available soon)

And past projects still available:

* Resistor Time for Pebble OS on the [Rebble App Store](https://store-beta.rebble.io/app/55561ff444dad6e1470000df)
