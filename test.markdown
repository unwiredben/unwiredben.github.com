## Biography

Ben has had a pretty active life in the mobile software world.  It's
documented in a more-or-less formal way on
[Ben's Stack Overflow Careers CV](cv).

Ben grew up in north Georgia, went to college in Atlanta at Georgia Tech, then
moved to Austin to work for Motorola's paging products group in IC design
verification.  After a few years, he moved into compilers, working on the
CodeWarrior tools made by Metrowerks.  He left for a startup, Veriprise, where
he learned Palm OS programming, when them led to Ben becoming lead developer
on CodeWarrior for Palm OS.  That led to a job at PalmSource in developer
relations, then a engineering job at Palm working on the Foleo netbook.  In
2008, Ben and his then-fiancée headed to Brooklyn, NY.  While there, Ben went
off to work at Mozilla on their mobile web browser but returned to Palm after
a year to work as engineering lead on the webOS developer relations team.  In
2011, he and his wife returned to Austin to start their new life of computer
hacking and urban farming.
